## CI

### GIT-SCM

- Branch names and Release Tags  
  Branch names should be different from release versions, if you are planning tagging the releases.  
  If a branch uses the same name as a tag, some git operations cannot work because of ambitious references.
- Large files  
  Do not save large files in your repository, unless you are sure git-lfs is supported, or the files won't be changed.  
  Do not save middle-sized binary file which will be changed frequently.
  By ware the CI pipelines will typically run many times, and the repository will be cloned/fetched several times in every build. An over-sized repository will cause more costs.
  Alternatives: git-lfs; artifact-storage or other file server with customized pipelines integrates the files into your released artifacts.
